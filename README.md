Stuff to do:
        

Some stuff noticed to fix eventually later for smooth user exp:

if refresh page on pfp message should be gone
Bug when starting need to double click and wait for fast refresh.


So the plan for prio now:
Userstatus fix maybe.
Sitedatalog fix needed a bit.
Comments good ones.
Read me update pics etc.

Then work on deployment.
Likely Vercel + railway? need to add docker as well.

Will have to add this https://developers.google.com/terms#a_your_end_users

REMINDER TO FIX DB COLLECTIONS FOR DELETED STUFF



Deploying update:
Front use vercel and then backend use hugging face
If doesnt work try other free options
else just do video showcase.


UPDATE HUGGING SPACE DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL FOR NOW
